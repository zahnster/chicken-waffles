# chicken-waffles

That thing when you make a tweet about dinner, and then you get a dare to make a website about it, so you do the thing.

And then you spend $5 on a url.

And then you spend $7 for a Heroku plan with SSL because you care about the session security of your users. They want chicken and waffles, not spies and spam.
